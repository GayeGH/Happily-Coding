# Happily Coding
## My Portfolio
## Description

For the Module 2 Challenge, our goal was to create a portfolio page with images of us, our first project and placeholder pictures. I linked the list items in the header to different sections of the page, and I linked an image from my first project to my Github page. 


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Users will find a brief description of Gaye Haslam with the "Happily Coding" webpage, a link to the project "Horiseon" in Github and contact information. A link to Mrs. Haslam's resume is being researched. :)
