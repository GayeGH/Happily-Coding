        Welcome to "Happily Coding"! My name is Gaye Haslam and I live in Greensboro, NC. I am currently enrolled in UNC's Coding Bootcamp to learn about web development. I have worked as a teacher with elementary students for many years as well as adaptive curriculum students. During the pandemic, I discovered that I really enjoyed working with different computer applications to teach, solve problems, and help parents with computer issues they were experiencing. I enjoy meeting and working with people and if you are looking for a web developer who is ready to create something that is visually pleasing as well as easily accessible for users, then please let me know!
